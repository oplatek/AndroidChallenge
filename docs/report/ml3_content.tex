(
The main purpose of this milestone is to improve data mining techniques by applying
methods related to computational linguistics and to try out how their work on real data.

This project extends project which I have done together with Peteris Nikiforovs. 
We have explored several classifiers used for data mining.
I decided to pick five most effective classifiers from previous project and apply 
as many techniques as possible from computational linguistic. 
In fact as we finished the data mining project we saw immediately that
we tried to classify our data with textual attributes with the simplest method.

For each technique we evaluated various algorithms described in the lectures and compared them to some others that were available to use in the data mining software packages that we used. 

We also extracted some new information using the models during the mining process. We will present the interesting foundations further on which is the goal of the MSR 2012 challange.

Note that we run similar experiments for classification twice. In Section~\ref{sec:Classification} we present experiments run in Rapid Miner and Appendix~\ref{cha:Weka} describes how to run the experiments in Weka.
